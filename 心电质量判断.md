1. 第一个规则，识别 R 波的峰值以确定 R 峰值（RR 间隔）和心率之间的时间间隔。如果估计的心率不在 40 到 180 次/分钟 (bpm) 之间，即心率的正常范围，则 ECG 部分被标记为受污染。
2. 对于第二条规则，如果 RR 间隔超过 3 秒或最大 RR 间隔与最小 RR 间隔的比率超过 2.2，则 ECG 片段被标记为污染。
3. 对于第三条规则，QRS 复合波被分割，QRS 模板通过平均分割的复合波创建。分段 QRS 复合波之间计算的平均相关系数，模板被用作最终特征。如果平均相关系数低于 0.66，则 ECG 部分也被标记为受污染。

### SSQIs analysis
The most commonly used SSQIs are relative power of QRS complex (SQI_p_), skewness (SQIskew), signal-to-noise ratio (SQIsnr) and peakedness of kurtosis (SQIkur). Usually, higher values of SQI_p_ (0.5 > SQI_p_ < 0.8), SQIskew (−0.8 > SQIskew ≤ 0.8), SNR (SQIsnr > 10 dB) and SQIkur (SQIkur > 5) indicate a noise-free ECG signal.
The aforementioned popular SSQIs are briefly discussed as follows:
**Kurtosis (SQIkur):** Selvaraj _et al._ observed that SQIkur is an indicator of ECG signal quality [[37](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C37)]. Kurtosis is a statistical measure describing the distribution of the inspected data throughout the mean. It expresses a large tail and peakedness or a tiny tail and flatness of distribution corresponding to the normal distribution. SQIkur can be calculated using
$SQI_{kur}= \frac1N ∑_{i=0}^N [(𝑥𝑖−𝑥)/\sigma]^4$
where _x_ denotes the ECG signal with _N_ sample points, 𝑥 and _σ_ represent the mean value and standard deviation of signal _x_, respectively.

**Signal-to-noise ratio (SQIsnr):** The SQIsnr is defined as the ratio of signal diversity to noise diversity [[38](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C38),[39](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C39)]. The signal diversity represents the variance of the absolute value of the ECG signal, while the noise variance is defined as the variance of the ECG signal. In [[39](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C39)], the authors proposed an ECG signal with an SNR ≥ 80 dB is good quality or acceptable for further processing. The SQIsnr is estimated as follows:
$SQI_{snr}= \frac{\sigma^2_{y}}{\sigma^2_{|y|}}$ where _y_ is the ECG signal.
**Higher-order statistics-SQI (SQIhos):** Nardelli _et al._ [[35](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C35)] proposed a novel index, SQIhos, using a combination of SQIskew and SQIkur of an ECG signal that is defined by
$SQI_{hos}=|SQI_{skew}|× \frac {SQI_{kur}}5$where SQIskew is denoted by $SQI_{skew}= \frac1N ∑_{i=0}^N [(𝑥𝑖−𝑥)/\sigma]^3$.
**Relative power of QRS complex (SQI_p_):** SQI_p_ is the ratio between the power spectral densities of the ECG signal spectrum and the QRS complex spectrum. ECG signals are generated between 0.05 and 125 Hz for clinical analysis where the QRS complex corresponds to the frequency range [0.05 − 45] Hz. Noise-free ECG signals typically have a distinctive QRS set [[23](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C23),[30](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0012#RSIF20220012C30)]. SQI_p_ is defined by
$SQI𝑝= \frac{∫^{15Hz}_{5Hz}𝑃(𝑓)df}{∫^{15Hz}_{5Hz}𝑃(𝑓)d𝑓}$where _P_(_f_) is the ECG power spectrum. The majority of the ECG’s power is concentrated in the 5–15 Hz frequency range.
